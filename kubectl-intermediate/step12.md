If we want to get output with nicely formatted column headers, then JSONPath's custom columns is the best option.

Custom-columns are easier to use than the range operator.
Here is how to use custom-columns with `kubectl`:

`kubectl get RESOURCE -o=custom-columns=COLUMN_HEADER:.JSONPATH QUERY`


Now, let's assume we want to  get all nodes within our cluster and nicely format the output with a column header called NAME. To do that, type the below command:

`kubectl get nodes -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name`{{execute}}

You can add additional columns to the above command by adding JSONPath pairs (COLUMN HEADER:.metadata) separated by a comma.

In the below command example, we are adding a CPU column header. Type the below command:

`kubectl get nodes -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,CPU:.status.capacity.cpu`{{execute}}

The previous command's output should now look similar to the below output:

```
NAME        CPU
master       2
node01       2
```

In step 9, we deployed multiple pods, so let's find all the pods that were deployed and output them in a tabulated format with column headers POD_NAME and IMAGE_VER:

`kubectl get pods -n frontend -o custom-columns=POD_NAME:.metadata.name,IMAGE_VER:.spec.containers[*].image`{{execute}}


**NOTE:** *Your environment may have a different CPU number for master and node01.*
